# SilverGuard by The Phisherman

An educational web application designed to help seniors (aged 65+) with limited technical experience recognize and avoid phishing scams. The app provides simple explanations of phishing tactics and interactive, realistic training scenarios to build quick recognition skills, reduce successful scams, and boost user confidence.

Phishing attacks cause significant financial loss and emotional distress, especially among older adults who may lack digital literacy. This tool empowers them through easy-to-understand education and safe practice.

## Why This Project?
According to the Federal Trade Commission, Americans lost $12.5 billion to online fraud in 2024 (a 25% increase year-over-year). By equipping potential victims with preemptive knowledge and skills, we can help prevent theft and empower users to spot suspicious messages before it's too late.

## Key Features (Planned)
- **Education Section**: Clear, senior-friendly explanations of phishing red flags (e.g., urgency, suspicious links, fake senders) with simple tips like "pause and verify."
- **Interactive Phishing Simulator**: Safe, realistic email/text message scenarios where users decide if it's phishing or legitimate, with immediate feedback and explanations.
- **Progress Dashboard**: Visualizes training results (e.g., success rate over time, pre- vs. post-training quiz scores) to track improvement and build confidence.
